<h2>Effective April 30, 2025, the US office of Blessing the Children International in Michigan is closed.</h2>
<hr />
<p>Donors may continue their support through the <strong> Canadian office of Blessing the Children International</strong>, or to work directly with the ministry <strong>Blessing the Children Development Organization</strong> in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>After 24 years of ministry, we at Blessing the Children International have closed our US Office, though the impact continues to touch thousands of lives through our sister organization which was founded in Ethiopia, <strong>Blessing the Children Development Organization</strong> (BCDO)&hellip; an NGO (non-governmental organization) organized in Ethiopia. Dawit Moges continues to serve faithfully as the director of BCDO.</p>
<p>In 2010, Rick &amp; Sheila Lamb joined a mission trip and fell in love with the children and the work we were doing in Ethiopia. Through that visit, God led them to open a Canadian office of Blessing the Children International, as a non-profit in Canada raising funds to also support the work in Ethiopia through BCDO.</p>
<p><strong>What does this look like for the ministry in Ethiopia? </strong></p>
<p>With support through the organization Blessing the Children International organized in Canada, BCDO will continue the work exactly as it is in Ethiopia. The children and families in Ethiopia will see no change to their support. God has provided us an amazing and competent group of people in Ethiopia that manage the sponsorship program there that will continue to carry out the good work of the ministry.</p>
<p>Continued support should be directed to <a href="https://blessingthechildren.ca/donate/">https://blessingthechildren.ca/donate/</a>, to be processed through the <strong>Canadian office of Blessing the Children International</strong>.</p>
